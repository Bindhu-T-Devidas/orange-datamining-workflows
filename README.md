# 🟠 Orange Data Mining – Simple Exploratory Workflows

>  This was a very simple and exploratory project aimed at understanding how to use the Orange Data Mining tool for classification, clustering, and time series analysis.

This repository contains `.ows` workflow files created using [Orange](https://orangedatamining.com/), a visual programming tool for data mining and machine learning. The goal was to explore Orange’s drag-and-drop interface to understand key data mining concepts through hands-on experimentation.
